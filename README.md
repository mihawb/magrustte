# Magrustte
Command line tool for image manipulation. Apply effects to images as a composition of filters in a pipeline-like manner,
which allows for adding and removing filters without the need to recalculate the whole image.  

Name is a portmanteau of the surname of a great surrealist painter RenÃ© Magritte, and the name of the language it's
written in - Rust. It's also a subtle nod to Google's deprecated image manipulation tool - Picasa.

## Features
As of `0.6.9` release, the following filters are supported or planned to be supported in the near future:
- [x] Sepia
- [x] Color invert
- [x] Grayscale
- [x] Threshold
- [x] Vignette
- [x] Hue rotate
- [x] Brightness
- [x] Contrast
- [x] Blur with gaussian, box, and median kernels
- [x] Sharpen
- [x] Bilateral
